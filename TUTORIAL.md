# Tutorial

Welcome on the tutorial, here you can learn the basics of LTHC

## The shell

Before running a program, you have to run the shell (shell.py)

The shell after starting

Here you can use the language instructions, and this shell have an exclusive function (only shell): ``exit`` , this command stop the shell

## Doing some maths

addition:       ``1 + 3``

substraction:   ``2.9 - 17``

multiplication: ``-17 * 19.5783``

division:       ``-3 / -4.2``


arithmetical negation:             ``-5``

quotient of an euclidean division: ``17.3 // 2.2``

modulo:                            ``15 % 7``

power operator:                    ``2 ^ 4``

## Playing with 'VAR'

With the ``VAR`` keyword, you can create variables, there are 3 direct variables types and 2 more special types

Use: ``VAR the_name_of_the_variable = <expression>``

You can create a 'NUM' type variable with a number

You can create a 'STRING' type variable with a string, a string is created by surrounding a text with ``"`` , the escape charater is ``\``

You can create a 'LIST' type variable with value ('LIST' are separed as more simple values in other list) between square brackets (``[]``)

You can assign to an other variable a 'FUNCTION' (created with ``FUNC``) or a 'BUILT-IN_FUNCTION'

## String manipulation

You can concatenate two strings with the ``+`` operator

You can replicate a string multiple times with the ``*`` operator and a number (or a 'NUM')

## List manipulation

Append and extend: ``listA + listB``

Extend: ``listA % listB``

Get the element at index b in a list: ``listA / b``

Remove (pop) the element at index b in a list: ``listA - b``

Replicate a list multiple times: ``listA * b``

Multiply each value of a list by an other value: ``listA ^ b`` (b is the other value)
